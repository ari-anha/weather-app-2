# Weather Forecast App (React)

The actual app has been deployed [here](https://weather-app-2.vercel.app/) using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## The app

This project was part of the Manchester Codes (@MCRcodes) curriculum.

It uses a weather API which contains the weather data from cities across the UK.

The form lets you search for the city which you want the weather information of. If you type an invalid city name, the app will alert you that the city does not exist.

This app was built using React. The design is mobile-friendly and responsive to adapt to different screen sizes.
